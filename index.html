<p> Dial *9999 for an English-speaking emergency service run by Family Medical Practice. That's <a href="http://www.star9999.vn">http://www.star9999.vn</a></p>
<p>You can also call 115 (ambulance), 114 (fire) and 113 (police), but it may not help much unless you speak Vietnamese. </p>

<h2>
<a id="i-need-a-cab" class="anchor" href="#i-need-a-cab" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I need a cab</h2>

<p>Stick to Vinasun or Mai Linh. Make sure the meter is at 11k or 12k VND when you start. Sometimes cabbies give change in batches, so don't rush out if you're shorted.</p>

<a id="i-need-a-sim" class="anchor" href="#i-need-a-sim" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I need a SIM</h2>

<p>Go with Mobifone, though Vinaphone and Viettel should also do the trick. Tariffs <a href="http://www.mobifone.com.vn/portal1/en/services/home/internet/dichvu3g/mobile_internet_gc.jsp">here</a>.
Text NN E to 901 to switch your admin language to English.
Top up with 200k VND and try BMIU to 999 for 3GB high speed internet (and unlimited low speed) for a month or KM120 for 1.5GB.</p>

<p>Mobifone <a href="http://naptien.mobifone.com.vn/wap/xhtml/card/en/check_sub.jsp">Account Balance &amp; Usage Statistics</a> - click while connected to mobile network.</p>

<p>
A more recent tip for 45gb of mobiphone 3g internet, for 300,000vnd per month. Valid as of <em>May 2016</em> - thanks Noah.

<ol>
<li>Cancel all current mobile plans.</li>
<li>Send the SMS "DK D10" to the number "999".</li>
<li>Make sure to toggle flight mode so the plan takes hold and you don't burn all your credit.</li>
<li>Have at least 10,000vnd loaded onto your mobiphone account every day.</li>
<li>Every day you'll get an autorenewed 1.5gb for 10,000vnd for the next 24 hours update text.</li>

<a id="where-should-i-live" class="anchor" href="#where-should-i-live" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where should I live?</h2>

<p>Wherever you like. If you want to bump into DCers stay near <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/WbNaz">18a Nguyen Thi Minh Khai (NTMK)</a>, which is the address of an alley. It's pretty easy to walk up and get a short term apartment on the same day for $200-350/month. Other than that D1 and D3 are nice and central. Further out has more new developments. Staying near Pham Ngu Lau / Bui Vien will mean street touts and backpackers.</p>

<h2>
<a id="i-need-an-affordable-hotel" class="anchor" href="#i-need-an-affordable-hotel" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I need an affordable hotel</h2>

<p>Good budget hotels around $20-25/day in the Dong Khoi, Japanese, and Cathedral Areas, where most DCers stay. Try the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g293925-d2505790-Reviews-White_Lotus_Hotel-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html">White Lotus Hotel</a>. Lots of other cheap options if you're ok staying in the Pham Ngu Lao / Bui Vien (touristy backpacker area). Try <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293925-d2242669-Reviews-Golden_Wind_Hotel-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html">Golden Wind Hotel</a></p>

<p>A lot of cheap accommodation like the ones listed above are bedsit-style rooms in a larger family house with an combined lounge / lobby. Many will lock their doors at a certain point at night. You may not get a key and they may not allow overnight visitors, so be sure to ask for details before choosing a place to stay. Also ask about things like maid service, water, laundry, as often they're included.</p>

<p>It's technically illegal for a Vietnamese girl to spend the night at your apartment. To avoid trouble you'll want to explicitly ask whether your landlord would allow "your Vietnamese girlfriend" to spend the night on occasion. You can avoid this hassle by upping your budget, renting your own apartment, or getting a houseshare. Search facebook for Ho Chi Minh housing groups or <a href="http://vietnam.craigslist.org/search/roo">Craigslist</a>, but ask to be sure.</p>

<p>For nicer apartments ($400-800 or $800-1500) contact this agent: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vunhuphuongchi">https://www.facebook.com/vunhuphuongchi</a>. She is very helpful and understands the needs of Westerners. Most agents only do long term (6+ months), but she also has some short term available.</p>

<a id="random-tips" class="anchor" href="#random-tips" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Random Tips</h2>

<p>Keep your iPhone in your pocket big boy (and ladies even more so). Avoid riding a scooter with a purse or laptop back slung over one shoulder. Street snatchings are a thing here, mostly near the backpacker area.</p>

<p>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/expatshcmc/">Expats in Ho Chi Minh Facebook group</a> for useful info.</p>

<p>If you're shopping for clothes the outskirts of Ben Thanh market are much cheaper than the market itself. E.g. 50K VND for a tank top compared to 160-475K VND deep inside the market. Start haggling at 30% of original asking price.</p>

<p><strong>Extension:</strong> Visa rules and price change pretty regularly. Check with one or more of the agents above to see your visa can be renewed without leaving the country and what the latest prices are.<br>
If you need to leave then your best bet is probably a plane trip to Thailand / Singapore or a day trip by bus to the Cambodia border (see below for details).</p>
<p><strong>Extension:</strong> Visa rules have changed as of early 2015. Currently it's not possible to get a 3 month extension without leaving the country and 1 month extensions are expensive (~$180). Your best bet is probably a plane trip to Thailand / Singapore or a day trip by bus to the Cambodia border (see below for details). This info is likely to change, so do ask around for the latest.</p>

<p>For the Cambodia Bus Option do as follows <a href="http://www.zerohasslemarketing.com/">thanks Juergen</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Get visa recommendation letter from visa agent ($65)</li>
<li>Make sure you have passport photo and USD</li>
<li>Take bus 703 that goes to Moc Bai from the bus station opposite Pham Ngu Lao 343. Leaves at 5.30am and 4.30pm. Takes 2,5 hours (40k VND each way).</li>
<li>Walk to the border.</li>
<li>Get exit stamp on the main building on the Vietnam side.</li>
<li>Walk to the Cambodia immigration buildings on the other side of the border.</li>
<li>Get entry visa Cambodia at the small buildings next to the main one ($32).</li>
<li>Go inside the main Cambodia building to get the visa stamped.</li>
<li>Wait for a bit.</li>
<li>Get exit stamp Cambodia at those same buildings.</li>
<li>Walk back to the Vietnam side of the border - go to the pink building on the left hand side of the main building.</li>
<li>Get entry visa Vietnam at pink building ($45).</li>
<li>Get entry visa stamped at main building. Just hand it to one of the clerks, and wait until they're done (can take a while).</li>
<li>Take the same bus back to Saigon.
The whole thing takes about 8 hours and costs $142.</li>
